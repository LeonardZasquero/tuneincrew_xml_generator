an XML Generator GUI for Tuneincrew (https://github.com/Telonof/TuneinCrew) done in python. have been used personally and seems to have no issue.

Entirely done by Deepseek. may have issues but so far so smooth for me. I'm not a programmer at all so please understand that i won't be maintaining this at all and i won't fix the issues because i can't. meanwhile feel free to snatch the source whatever you like.

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.x

- PyQt5

- Mutagen (for audio metadata extraction)

Features:

- GUI (duh)

- Save current XML or Save As

- Automatic metadata filling

- Drag and drop music files (drop it into a music file tab otherwise it wont work)
